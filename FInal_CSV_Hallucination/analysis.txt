⏺ Perfect! Here's a summary of the hallucination examples:                                                      12:01 AM  claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

  📊 10 HALLUCINATION EXAMPLES PER MODEL

  Common Hallucination Patterns Across All Models:

  1. Yes/No Disagreements - Models answer opposite to ground truth
    - Question: "Is there a beach?" → GT: "no" → Model: "Yes, there is a beach"
  2. Object Existence Errors - Claiming objects exist/don't exist incorrectly
    - Question: "Is there a sports ball?" → GT: "yes" → Model: "No, there is no sports ball"
  3. Mathematical/Geometric Errors - Wrong geometric conclusions
    - Question: "Is CF equal to BF?" → GT: "no" → Model: "Yes"
  4. Fabricated Details - Adding non-existent items
    - Question: "What does Trump's hat say?" → GT: "He doesn't have a hat" → Model: "Make America Great Again"
  5. Visual Misinterpretation - Incorrectly describing visual attributes
    - Question: "Is the forest withering?" → GT: "no" → Model: "Yes, the forest appears to be withering"

  Key Observations:

  - Qwen2.5-VL-7B (6.06% error): Fewest hallucinations, mostly on complex yes/no questions
  - Gemma 3 12B (10.58% error): More verbose explanations, sometimes over-interprets
  - Molmo-7B (12.05% error): Tends to hallucinate visual details and object existence
  - LLaVA-NeXT (13.59% error): Most hallucinations, especially on binary questions and visual attributes

  All examples show the models being confidently wrong - providing detailed explanations for incorrect answers,
   which makes these hallucinations particularly problematic for real-world applications.

  The manually reviewed datasets with these flagged hallucinations are now ready for your HALP research!
