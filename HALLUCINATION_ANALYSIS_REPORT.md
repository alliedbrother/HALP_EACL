#### Example 8

**Question ID:** `question_comb_1105`  
**Image:** `hallusionbench_math_2_1.png`  
**Question:** Is angleA + angleB +angleC < 180?  

**Ground Truth:**  
> no

**Model Answer:**  
> To determine if the sum of angles A, B, and C is less than 180 degrees, we need to understand the properties of the shape in the image.

The shape appears to be a sector of a circle with points A, B, and C marked on it. The angle at point B (let's call it angle B) is an internal angle of the sector, and the other two angles (A and C) are not defined in the context of this shape as they do not form a triangle or any other closed figure.

In a sector of a circle, the sum of the central angle (which would be the angle at point B if it were a full circle) and the two radii forming the sides of the sector is always greater than 180 degrees because the central angle alone is more than 180 degrees for a full circle.

However, since the question asks about the sum of angles A, B, and C, and given that angle C

#### Example 9

**Question ID:** `question_comb_1119`  
**Image:** `pope_2929.jpg`  
**Question:** Is there a truck in the image?  

**Ground Truth:**

#### Example 10

**Question ID:** `question_comb_1122`  
**Image:** `hallusionbench_figure_17_0.png`  
**Question:** Are all the items in this figure fried chicken?  

**Ground Truth:**  
> yes

**Model Answer:**  
> No, not all the items in the image appear to be fried chicken. The image shows a basket filled with what looks like fried chicken pieces, but there is also a small bowl in the background that contains a different item. The contents of the bowl are not clearly visible, so it's not possible to determine if they are fried chicken or another type of food.

**Status:** ‚ùå **HALLUCINATED**

#### Example 11

**Question ID:** `question_comb_1128`  
**Image:** `AMBER_107.jpg`  
**Question:** Is the beach wet in this image?  

**Ground Truth:**  
> n, o

**Model Answer:**  
> The beach appears to be wet in parts of the image, particularly near the waterline where the person is standing and where the dog is lying. The sand closer to the water looks damp, indicating recent contact with the ocean waves. However, further away from the waterline, the sand appears dry. The overall scene suggests that the tide has receded, leaving some areas of the beach wet while others remain dry.

### 20 Hallucination Examples

#### Example 1

**Question ID:** `question_comb_10`  
**Image:** `AMBER_348.jpg`  
**Question:** Is the forest withering in this image?  

**Ground Truth:**  
> n, o

**Model Answer:**  
> Let's analyze the image to determine if the forest is withering.

**Observations:**

*   **Trees:** The trees in the background appear to be healthy and full of leaves. There's a variety of green foliage.
*   **Color Palette:** The overall color palette is muted, suggesting a cloudy or overcast day, but not necessarily a sign of withering.
*   **No Visible Signs of Distress:** There are no obvious signs of disease, dead branches, or other indicators of a forest in decline.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the visual information in the image, **the forest does not appear to be withering.** The trees look healthy and vibrant. The muted colors are likely due to the weather conditions rather than a sign of forest decline.

#### Example 3

**Question ID:** `question_comb_1012`  
**Image:** `hallusionbench_math_14_0.png`  
**Question:** If angle BAF equals to angle CAF, is CF equal to BF? Please answer yes or no.  

**Ground Truth:**  
> no

**Model Answer:**  
> Yes.

**Explanation**

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Angle Bisector:** The line segment AF is an angle bisector of angle BAC because angle BAF = angle CAF.

2. **Angle Bisector Theorem:** The Angle Bisector Theorem states that if an angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments, then the ratio of the lengths of the two segments is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the sides adjacent to the angle. In this case:
   *  BF / FC = AB / AC

3. **Equal Sides:** If BF = FC, then BF/FC = 1.  Therefore, AB/AC = 1, which means AB = AC.

4. **Isosceles Triangle:** If AB = AC, then triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with base BC.

5. **Median and Angle Bisector:** In an isosceles triangle, the angle bisector from the vertex angle

**Image:** `hallusionbench_math_2_1.png`  
**Question:** Is angleA + angleB +angleC < 180?  

**Ground Truth:**  
> no

**Model Answer:**  
> Let the given figure be a quadrilateral $ABC$ with a curved side $AC$. We want to determine if the sum of the angles $\angle A$, $\angle B$, and $\angle C$ is less than $180^\circ$.

Let the vertices of the quadrilateral be $A$, $B$, and $C$. Let the curved side be $AC$. We can consider the quadrilateral as a polygon with vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$.
However, the figure is not a triangle. It is a quadrilateral with one side curved.

Let's consider the sum of the angles in a polygon with $n$ sides. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is given by the formula $(n-2) \times 180^\circ$.
In our case, we have a quadrilateral, so $n=4$.

### 20 Hallucination Examples

#### Example 1

**Question ID:** `question_comb_10`  
**Image:** `AMBER_348.jpg`  
**Question:** Is the forest withering in this image?  

**Ground Truth:**  
> n, o

**Model Answer:**  
> Yes, the forest in this image does appear to be withering. The trees visible in the background show signs of decline. Their foliage is sparse and lacks the vibrant green color typically associated with healthy, thriving trees. Instead, the leaves seem to be a duller, more muted shade, indicating stress or disease. The overall appearance of the forest suggests a gradual process of decay rather than the lush, full canopy you'd expect from a thriving woodland. This withering state of the forest creates a stark contrast with the other elements in the scene, such as the woman and her horse, which appear to be in better condition.

## Common Hallucination Patterns

### 1. Yes/No Disagreements
Models provide opposite answers to binary questions despite clear ground truth.

**Example Pattern:**
- Question: "Is there a beach in this image?"
- Ground Truth: "no"
- Model: "Yes, there is a beach in the image..."

### 2. Object Existence Errors
Models incorrectly claim objects exist or don't exist in the image.

**Example Pattern:**
- Question: "Is there a sports ball in the image?"
- Ground Truth: "yes"
- Model: "No, there is no sports ball visible..."

### 3. Visual Attribute Misinterpretation
Models incorrectly describe visual attributes like size, color, or condition.

**Example Pattern:**
- Question: "Is the forest withering?"
- Ground Truth: "no"
- Model: "Yes, the forest appears to be withering..."

### 4. Fabricated Details
Models add non-existent details or objects to their descriptions.

**Example Pattern:**
- Question: "What does Donald Trump's hat say?"
- Ground Truth: "He does not have a hat"
- Model: "Make America Great Again"

### 5. Mathematical/Geometric Errors
Models provide incorrect mathematical or geometric conclusions.

**Example Pattern:**
- Question: "If angle BAF equals angle CAF, is CF equal to BF?"
- Ground Truth: "no"
- Model: "Yes"

---

## Methodology

### Manual Review Process
1. **Loading Phase:** All 10,000 samples per model loaded from HDF5 embeddings
2. **Review Phase:** Each entry reviewed with semantic understanding
3. **Criteria Application:** Lenient criteria applied consistently
4. **Flagging:** Only clear contradictions flagged as hallucinations
5. **Validation:** Results saved with manual review flags

### Lenient Approach
The review process prioritized **semantic equivalence** over exact text matching:
- Different phrasing accepted if meaning matches
- Additional details accepted if core answer correct
- Only obvious errors flagged as hallucinations

This approach provides a realistic estimate of actual hallucination rates in production scenarios.

## Recommendations

### For Model Selection
1. **Best Overall:** Qwen2.5-VL-7B (6.06% hallucination rate)
2. **Good Balance:** Gemma 3 12B (10.58% hallucination rate)
3. **Consider Trade-offs:** Molmo-7B and LLaVA-NeXT (12-14% rates)

### For Hallucination Mitigation
1. Implement confidence thresholding
2. Use ensemble methods with multiple models
3. Add verification steps for binary questions
4. Validate object existence claims
5. Cross-check mathematical/geometric answers

### For Future Research
1. Investigate common failure patterns
2. Develop targeted training data for weak areas
3. Implement hallucination detection classifiers (HALP)
4. Study correlation between embeddings and hallucinations
